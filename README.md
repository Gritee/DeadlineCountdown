# DeadlineCountdown
An RCOS project

## About
Our software is a deadline management software that gathers all deadline information 
that are scattered on multiple homework submission webpages and shows all deadline 
information on a list and a calendar, helping users to visualize deadline information 
and thus memorize deadlines and manage time for study more efficiently. One of the 
most important function of this application is that it will notify you when your 
deadline approaches or changes. This feature can largely decrease the chance that a 
user misses his/her deadline and the probability that a user spends time on a deadline 
that no longer exists, so he/she can manage his/her time more efficiently.

## Features
- Automatically or manually add deadlines and show those on a calendar
- Alarms when the deadlines is approaching (Notification)
- Show the status beside the date.
- Access the submission webpage directly through the webpage
- Provides a countdown timer on Due Day which is really exciting
- If the user is a TA, he/she can also see the due dates for the homework he/she is 
about to grade.
